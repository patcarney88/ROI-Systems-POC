# 🌐 Make Vercel Site Publicly Accessible

## 🚨 Current Issue
Your Vercel deployment is requiring authentication (SSO/login) to view. This needs to be disabled for public client demos.

## ✅ Solution: Disable Vercel Protection

### **Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard**
Visit: https://vercel.com/pat-carneys-projects/frontend/settings

### **Step 2: Navigate to Deployment Protection**
1. Click on your project: **frontend**
2. Go to **Settings** (top navigation)
3. Scroll to **Deployment Protection** section

### **Step 3: Disable Protection**

You'll see options like:
- **Vercel Authentication** - Turn this OFF
- **Password Protection** - Make sure this is OFF
- **Trusted IPs** - Make sure this is OFF

**Action**: 
- Set **Deployment Protection** to **Disabled** or **Off**
- Or set to **Only Preview Deployments** (keeps production public)

### **Step 4: Save Changes**
Click **Save** at the bottom of the settings page.

## 🔄 Alternative: Redeploy with Public Flag

If the dashboard method doesn't work, you can also:

```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod --yes --public
```

This forces the deployment to be public.

## 🎯 Verify Public Access

After making changes:

1. **Open an incognito/private browser window**
2. **Visit**: https://frontend-h2wtyvvrh-pat-carneys-projects.vercel.app
3. **Should load immediately** without login prompt
