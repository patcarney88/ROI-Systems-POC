# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of ROI Systems seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Responsible Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues to:
- **Email:** security@roisystems.com
- **Subject:** [SECURITY] Brief description of the issue
- **PGP Key:** Available upon request

### What to Include

Please provide the following information:
1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
4. **Suggested fix** (if available)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 24 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline:** Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-3 days
  - High: 3-7 days
  - Medium: 7-14 days
  - Low: 14-30 days

### Recognition

We appreciate the security research community's efforts to improve our security. Researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Acknowledged in our security advisories (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
- Invited to our security acknowledgments page
- Eligible for bug bounty rewards (if program is active)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Never share your credentials** with anyone
2. **Use strong passwords** (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
3. **Enable two-factor authentication** when available
4. **Keep your software updated** to the latest version
5. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Follow secure coding guidelines** (OWASP)
4. **Run security tests** before merging
5. **Keep dependencies updated** (npm audit)

### For Administrators

1. **Use strong secrets** (64+ character hex strings)
2. **Enable rate limiting** on all endpoints
3. **Use HTTPS** in production (required)
4. **Implement logging** and monitoring
5. **Regular security audits** and penetration testing

## Known Security Considerations

### Current POC Limitations

This is a Proof of Concept with the following security considerations:

#### CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Production
- Mock data storage (no database implementation)
- Hardcoded default secrets in docker-compose
- No rate limiting implementation
- Missing CSRF protection
- No refresh token rotation

#### HIGH - Should Fix Before Production
- Basic Helmet configuration
- Single CORS origin support
- No virus scanning on file uploads
- Limited audit logging

See `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for complete details and remediation steps.

## Security Features

### Implemented

- [x] Helmet.js security headers
- [x] CORS protection
