# üîí Security Framework & Compliance
## Digital Docs Platform - ROI Systems POC

### Security Overview
Comprehensive security framework implementing Zero Trust architecture for the Digital Docs platform. Designed to protect sensitive real estate documents, client data, and business communications while maintaining compliance with industry regulations.

### Security Principles
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify everything, trust nothing
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for users and systems
- **Security by Design**: Built-in security from architecture to implementation
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response
