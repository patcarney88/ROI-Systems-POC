# 🏗️ Microservices Architecture Design
## Digital Docs Platform - ROI Systems POC

### Architecture Overview
Cloud-native microservices architecture designed for the Digital Docs platform, supporting the three core workflows: document management, forever marketing, and instant alerts. Built for scale, security, and Claude AI integration.

### Design Principles
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services organized around business capabilities
- **API-First**: All services expose RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specs
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication via message queues
- **Cloud-Native**: Containerized, auto-scaling, resilient
- **Security by Design**: Zero-trust architecture with end-to-end encryption

```yaml
Message Queue (Redis/RabbitMQ):
  Events:
    - document.uploaded
    - document.shared
    - user.registered
    - campaign.sent
    - alert.delivered
    - ai.analysis.complete
    
  Patterns:
    - Publish/Subscribe for notifications
    - Request/Reply for synchronous operations
    - Event Sourcing for audit trails
    - Dead letter queues for error handling
```

### API Communication Patterns
```yaml
Synchronous (REST):
  - User authentication
  - Document retrieval
  - Search queries
  - Real-time operations

Asynchronous (Events):
  - Document processing
  - Email campaigns
  - Analytics events
  - AI analysis tasks

Circuit Breaker Pattern:
  - Timeout: 30s
  - Failure threshold: 5 consecutive failures
  - Recovery time: 60s
```
