## ðŸŽ¯ Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Critical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Security breach during dev | Medium | Critical | Deploy security team Week 1, no production data |
| Database migration failure | Low | High | Extensive testing, rollback plan |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Performance engineer monitoring continuously |
| Deployment failure | Low | Critical | Blue-green deployment, rollback automation |
| Budget overrun | Low | Medium | Weekly budget reviews, scope control |

### Contingency Plans

**If Week 1-2 delayed:**
- Extend timeline by 1 week
- Prioritize security over testing
- Adjust Week 3-4 scope

**If critical bugs found Week 7:**
- Deploy incident-responder agent
- Delay launch 1 week if needed
- Increase testing coverage

**If performance targets not met:**
- Extend Week 7 by 3 days
- Add performance-engineer hours
- Defer non-critical optimizations
